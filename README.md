# Web Scraping and NLP Article Summarizer

A Python project that analyzes news articles using natural language processing techniques to create automatic summaries.

## What it does
- Scrapes article content from the web
- Analyzes sentiment (positive/negative tone) 
- Finds the most common words and word roots
- Creates summaries using two different methods
- Compares which summary method works better

## The Article
I analyzed a fun news story about cats running for "mayor" of a bike path in Somerville, Massachusetts that got hijacked by other animals joining the race.

## Tools Used
- Python
- spaCy for text processing
- BeautifulSoup for web scraping
- TextBlob for sentiment analysis
- Matplotlib for data visualization

## Results
Created two different summaries (8 and 6 sentences) from a 26-sentence article. The longer summary captured more context and was more engaging.

Built for Web Mining & NLP class final project.
